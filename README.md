# Operating System Project
Making an operating system from zero. This project will consist of research and eventual development of an operating system, starting from our current (January 20223) knowledgeâ€”nothing. Through reading and tutorial, we will eventually reach a level sufficient to create the most elementary parts of an operating system running, before likely calling it a day.
But who can say how long that will take, or how far we'll take it? Until then, we shall document any updates and developments right here.
