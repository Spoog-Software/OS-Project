# Operating System Project
Making an operating system from zero. This project will consist of research and eventual development of an operating system, starting from our current (January 20223) knowledgeâ€”nothing. Through reading and tutorial, we will eventually reach a level sufficient to create the most elementary parts of an operating system running, before likely calling it a day.

## Toolchain
The currently-in-use toolchain is a cross-compiler to a generic i686-ELF-based system, which is used to output code for the target OS.
In order to create the cross-compiler, we compile GCC with the i686-elf target.
You can do this with the script `xcompiler_install.sh`; GCC is complex software inherent with compilation bugs, so there may initially be a number
of issues, although with luck, if you have all the needed dependencies (the script ensures most of them are there), you will not encounter them.
